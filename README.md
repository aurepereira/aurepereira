### AurÃ©lien Pereira

> _Keep it simple, stupid._

I am a full-stack developer working in IP protection. I currently develop a user-friendly software solution designed to make patent management accessible for small businesses, startups and innovators.

Here for the thrill of figuring things out. I like good design, lean code, minimalism in all things, and pestering people about good UX.
