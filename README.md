I am a full-stack developer working in IP protection. I currently develop and maintain a solution providing clients with tools to oversee and manage the lifecycle of IP rights such as patents, trademarks, utility models, etc.

Here for the thrill of figuring things out. I like good design, lean code, minimalism in all things, and pestering people about good UX.
